Image Classification on CIFAR-10 using basic CNN and modified CNN

Image Classification has changed and accelerated technical breakthroughs in a variety of industries, including automobiles, healthcare, manufacturing, and more.

The goal is to use the CIFAR-10 dataset to train a Convolutional Neural Network and use it to predict or classify a given image. The CIFAR-10 dataset has 60000 images separated into ten classes, each with 6000 images. Airplane, Automobile, Bird, Cat, Deer, Dog, Frog, Horse, Ship, and Truck are the classes. There are five training batches and one test batch in the dataset. The test batch consists of 1000 images chosen at random from each class.
